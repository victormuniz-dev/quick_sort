# Quick Sort

<p>The Quick Sort algorithm is based on the divide to conquer sorting method. It has a O(n log n) in the better case and O(n^2) in the worst case time complexity and uses partition method to divede the vector in the middle. On that exemple, I have implemented the recursive form of quick sort</p>

- The batter case is when the pivot is on the middle of the array after the partition.
- The worst case, when the pivot is near of the bounds of the array.
